# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualization_Demo
This is a demo program showing the visualization of 4 different sorting algorithms using C++ and OpenGL library

This project was completed on 10/27/2018, and was just uploaded to my Github account recently

This project visualizes the following 4 sorting algorithms: 
1. selection sort
2. bubble sort
3. quick sort
4. merge sort. 

Before sorting, the ordered array of blocks is randomly shuffled.

What is cool about this project is that all 4 sorting algorithms are actually implemeted in the code, 
not just some pre-arrangement of blocks. 
The array of blocks are indeed shuffled randomly and sorted using these algorithms. 
So every time you run the program, it will give different initial arrangement. 
You can also change the number of blocks in the array to see the speed comparison of these sorting algorithms.
